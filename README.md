\# 100 Days of DSA



This repository contains my daily Data Structures and Algorithms practice implemented in C as part of a 100-day consistency challenge.



\## Structure

* Solutions are grouped in folders of 10 days
* Each file contains one clean implementation 



\## Language

* C (GCC compatible)



\## Goal

To build strong fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms.
